Riddle NÂ° 1:

A farmer is on the west bank of a river with a wolf, a goat and a cabbage in his care. 
Without his presence the wolf would eat the goat or the goat would eat the cabbage. 
The wolf is not interested in the cabbage. The farmer wishes to bring his three charges across the river.
However the boat available to him can only carry one of the wolf, goat and cabbage besides himself. 
The puzzle is: is there a sequence of river crossings so that the farmer can transfer himself and the other
three all intact to the east bank?
